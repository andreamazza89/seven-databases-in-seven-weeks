# Chapter 6 - Neo4J

Neo4J is not so much about storing _things_ but more about how they _connect_ with each other.

Neo4J is a _graph_ database, as in based off of mathematical graphs, where you have nodes and edges.
It focuses on relationships between data. It is known as "whiteboard friendly" as any diagram that you can draw
on a whiteboard you can store on this db.
